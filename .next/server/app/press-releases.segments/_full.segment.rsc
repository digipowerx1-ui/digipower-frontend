This news release constitutes a "designated news release" for the purposes of the Company's prospectus supplement dated May 30, 2025 to its short form base shelf prospectus dated May 15, 2025.

MIAMI, Nov. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Digi Power X Inc. ("Digi Power X" or the "Company") (Nasdaq: DGXX / TSXV: DGX), an innovative energy infrastructure company, today announced a significant strengthening of its balance sheet and liquidity position to support its 2026 AI infrastructure development and is also pleased to provide unaudited comparative production results for the month ended October 31, 2025, combined with an operations update. All monetary references are expressed in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated.

Strong Balance Sheet with Liquidity to Fund Growth

The Company held cash, Bitcoin ("BTC"), Ethereum ("ETH") and cash deposits of approximately $85 million as of October 31, 2025, as compared to $29 million on September 30, 2025 (based on a BTC price of $109,600 as of October 31, 2025, and $113,300 as of September 30, 2025, per CoinMarketCap, and an ETH price of $3,800 as of October 31, 2025, and $4,160 as of September 30, 2025, per CoinMarketCap). This robust liquidity positions Digi Power X to accelerate the rollout of its 2026 AI infrastructure development plan, which includes the planned deployment of high-efficiency Tier III AI data centers and expansion of the Company's critical power capacity across multiple U.S. sites.
Digi Power X expanded its inventory of BTC from approximately 100 BTC as of September 30, 2025, to 112 BTC as of October 31, 2025, representing an increase of 12% over the previous month, through its mining activities (as described in more detail below).
Digi Power X held approximately 1,000 ETH as of October 31, 2025, with a fair market value of approximately $3.8 million (based on an ETH price of $3,800 as of October 31, 2025 per CoinMarketCap), as compared to a fair market value of approximately $4.2 million as of September 30, 2025 (based on an ETH price of $4,160 as of September 30, 2025 per CoinMarketCap). The Company's ETH position is currently staked to generate an annualized return of roughly 3% in rewards. This yield provides an additional recurring revenue stream while maintaining exposure to ETH's long-term appreciation potential.
The value of BTC produced at the Company's facilities between its self-mining and colocation agreements and energy sales was approximately $3.4 million on October 31, 2025 (based on a BTC price of $109,600 as of October 31, 2025, per CoinMarketCap).
Miners running at the Company's facilities produced approximately 25 BTC during the month between self-mining and colocation agreements, representing an approximate value of $2.7 million (based on a BTC price of $109,600 as of October 31, 2025, per CoinMarketCap).
